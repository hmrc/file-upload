This API provides a mechanism whereby a client microservice can define and manage an envelope which can later be filled with files and then optionally routed to another system. The envelope resources are exposed on the /file-upload/envelopes endpoint. Please <i>**DO NOT USE**</i> Test-Only endpoints because they are not available in production and the Internal endpoints specified <i>**WITHOUT PERMISSION.**</i>

## Software Requirements
*   MongoDB 4.2

## Run the application locally

To run the application execute

```
sbt run
```

The endpoints can then be accessed with the base url http://localhost:8898/

### Envelope

#### Create an Envelope
Creates an envelope and auto generates an Id. The body in the http request must be json. Successful response is provided in the Location Header which will have the link of the newly created envelope.
```
POST   	/file-upload/envelopes
```
| Responses    | Status    | Description |
| --------|---------|-------|
| Ok  | 201   | Successfully created envelope. |
| Bad Request | 400   |  Envelope not created, with some reason message |

#### Example
Request (POST): localhost:8898/file-upload/envelopes

Body:
``` json
{
    "callbackUrl": "string representing absolute url",
    "metadata": { "any": "valid json object" },
    "constraints": 	{
          "maxItems": 5,
          "maxSize": "25MB",
          "maxSizePerItem": "10KB",
          "contentTypes": ["application/pdf","image/jpeg","application/xml"]
        }
}
```

Note: All parameters are optional.
A [callbackUrl](#callback) is optional but should be provided in order for the service to provide feedback of the envelope's progress.
All constraints are optional for users, default constraints apply if the value is not specified in the create envelope call.

| Attribute    | Options    | Accepted Values | Default    | Description |
| --------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| constraints.contentTypes  | optional   | application/pdf<br/>image/jpeg<br/>application/xml<br/>text/xml<br/>application/vnd.ms-excel<br/>application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet  | application/pdf<br/>image/jpeg<br/>application/xml<br/>text/xml  | MIME types accepted by this envelope  |
| constraints.maxItems | optional   |  1-100 |  100  | Number of items allowed in this envelope  |
| constraints.maxSize | optional   | [1-9][0-9]{0,3}(KB&#124;MB) e.g. 1024KB |  25MB  | Maximum Size (sum of files' sizes) for the envelope (Maximum size 250MB)  |
| constraints.maxSizePerItem | optional   |  [1-9][0-9]{0,3}(KB&#124;MB) e.g. 1024KB |  10MB  | Maximum Size for each file (Maximum size 100MB)  |

1. `constraints.contentTypes` and `constraints.maxSizePerItem` are applied when the file is uploaded. If validation fails, the user will receive an error.
2. `constraints.maxItems` and `constraints.maxSize` are applied when the file is routed. Your application may be able to exceed these limits during upload but will not be able to route the envelope.
3. `constraints.allowZeroLengthFiles` is longer respected. Empty files will be treated as if no file was uploaded.

### Routing

#### Create File Routing Request
Changes the status of an envelope to CLOSED and auto generates a routing Id. The status change, rejects any requests to add files to the envelope. This makes it available for file transfer. To make the request, the envelope Id, application and destination must be provided. A response is provided in the Location Header with a link and a new autogenerated routing Id. In regards to MVP, only DMS is supported.
```
POST    /file-routing/requests
```

| --------|---------|-------|
| Created  | 201   | Successfully created routing request.  |
