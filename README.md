This API provides a mechanism whereby a client microservice can define and manage an envelope which can later be filled with files and then optionally routed to another system.
The envelope resources are exposed on the /file-upload/envelopes endpoint.

## Run the application locally

To run the application execute

```
sbt run
```

The endpoints can then be accessed with the base url http://localhost:8898/

## Endpoints

Alternatively  look  here for a [RAML definition](raml/file-upload.raml)
